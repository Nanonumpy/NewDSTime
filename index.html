    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:15px"> This site is to demonstrate a solution for daylight savings time that lets us have both standard time and daylight savings without having to ever change our clocks or our schedules.  This process will compensate every second throughout the year that will be either shorter or longer to spread the "spring forward" and "fall back" over time. So daylight savings traditionally begins on a Sunday morning in early March and ends on a Sunday morning in early November.  For this solution it doesn't matter what day it is so it will begin on March 1st and end on November 1st.  So the 8 month period of daylight savings will be 35 weeks long which comes to 21,168,000 seconds and the standard time of 4 months will be 17 weeks and one day (or on a leap year, 17 weeks and 2 days) which comes to 10,368,000 seconds. The hour that we "fall back" on, on November 1st will be lost throughout the 8 months divided into every second making the seconds slightly shorter. So instead of one second being equal to 1, they are now ticking off at a rate of 0.99982993.  On the inverse of this, during the 4 months out of the year for standard time, the one hour we "spring forward" to will be added to every second during that time. So instead of the seconds being equal to 1, they are ticking off at 1.00034722.  So the seconds ticking off will ebb and flow throughout the year so, again, we never have to adjust any clocks again or our schedule.  Essentially we are re-defining time measurement to better match the seasons that we live with.  No more adjusting.</p>
