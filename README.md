# NewDSTime
Hosting a website to display a new daylight savings method
The only files you should edit are index.html for the website html and /src/index.js or /src/index.ts for the script of the website. 
If you do make changes to the typescript file, you will first need to compile it to javascript using tsc /src/index.ts 
Before commiting, be sure to run "npm run build" in the terminal to allow the files readable by the website to be updated.
Finally, commit your changes.
